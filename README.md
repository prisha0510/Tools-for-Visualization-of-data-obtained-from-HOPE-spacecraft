# Tools-for-visualization-of-data-obtained-from-HOPE-spacecraft
Contains tools made using python language for visualization of data obtained from the 3 instruments onboard the HOPE spacecraft. 
This project consists of developing routines to read and plot the data from the different instruments onboard HOPE. It also includes working with some data processing, like increasing the signal-to noise ratio of the data, and applying interpolation methods. The idea is to create a series of tools to easily select and visualize the data, as a function of different parameters. The programming was done using python language.
